# SkillUp360

Welcome to the official repository for the SkillUp360 project — a learning hub that blends language, tech, and nostalgia into one experience. This site is built on the belief that we learn best by doing and teaching others.

## 🔑 Project Pillars

- 🗣️ **Pass It On: Shona** — Learn the Shona language by teaching it to others.
- 🕹️ **BackTo80s** — Rediscover and teach retro games from the '80s and '90s.
- 💻 **DevDojo** — Become a better web developer by building real-life, useful apps.

> Join the journey. Teach, learn, build. Skill up.
